Jansen, is one of the first manuscripts that address the human - system interaction of Web searching in a thorough and complete manner. The authors provide an examination of Web searching from multiple levels of analysis, from theoretical overview to detailed study of term usage, and integrate these different levels of analysis into a coherent picture of how people locate information on the Web using search engines. Drawing primarily on their own research and work in the field, the authors present the temporal changes in, the growth of, and the stability of how people interact with Web search engines. Drs. Spink and Jansen present results from an analysis of multiple search engine data sets over a six year period, giving a firsthand account of the emergence of Web searching. They also compare and contrast their findings to the results of other researchers in the field, providing a valuable bibliographic resource. This research is directly relevant to those interested in providing information or services on the Web, along with those who research and study the Web as an information resource. Graduate students, academic and corporate researchers, search engine designers, information architects, and search engine optimizers will find the book of particular benefit.",

He's timed the arrival of his computer components with the holiday vacation from school to blast aliens and enemy soldiers alike on his brand new, high-end gaming computer. When the parts arrive, it soon becomes apparent that they aren't what he ordered from TechTerritory. Thinking he's the butt of a practical joke, Tyler plays along, and builds the computer with the obviously fake components. His annoyance turns to shock when the computer powers on. His shock turns to a mix of disbelief and wonder when he learns the strange \"quantum\" computer can pull web pages from the near future. Disbelief and wonder soon become fear and uncertainty when he discovers the future might not be so bright. \"Search Terms: Alpha\" is the first half of a new time travel thriller. 52,000 word novel Adult themes / language / mild sexual content",

By the time you're finished with the book, you'll be ready to build amazing search engines that deliver the results your users need and that get better as time goes on! Foreword by Chris Mattmann. Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications. About the Technology Deep learning handles the toughest search challenges, including imprecise search terms, badly indexed data, and retrieving images with minimal metadata. And with modern tools like DL4J and TensorFlow, you can apply powerful DL techniques without a deep background in data science or natural language processing (NLP). This book will show you how. About the Book Deep Learning for Search teaches you to improve your search results with neural networks. You'll review how DL relates to search basics like indexing and ranking. Then, you'll walk through in-depth examples to upgrade your search with DL techniques using Apache Lucene and Deeplearning4j. As the book progresses, you'll explore advanced topics like searching through images, translating user queries, and designing search engines that improve as they learn! What's inside Accurate and relevant rankings Searching across languages Content-based image search Search with recommendations About the Reader For developers comfortable with Java or a similar language and search basics. No experience with deep learning or NLP needed. About the Author Tommaso Teofili is a software engineer with a passion for open source and machine learning. As a member of the Apache Software Foundation, he contributes to a number of open source projects, ranging from topics like information retrieval (such as Lucene and Solr) to natural language processing and machine translation (including OpenNLP, Joshua, and UIMA). He currently works at Adobe, developing search and indexing infrastructure components, and researching the areas of natural language processing, information retrieval, and deep learning. He has presented search and machine learning talks at conferences including BerlinBuzzwords, International Conference on Computational Science, ApacheCon, EclipseCon, and others. You can find him on Twitter at @tteofili.
